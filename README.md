# Recipe search and recommendation system

This is project is part of the Multimedia Search & Recommendation Course CS4065. The task of this system is to provide a top list of recipes based on user preferences and supermarket deals. For this there are 3 subsystems. Subsystem 1 (system1.py) is the search system that looks in a dataset of 20,000 recipes (epi_r.csv and full_format_recipes.json) for the most affordable recipes based on supermarket offers (offers.json)


Subsystem 2 finds the most favourable recipes for a user based on his previously liked recipes (system2.py) and subsystem 3 finds the most favourable recipes based on users with similar taste (system3.py). For this we use a user-item matrix (ratings.csv).
